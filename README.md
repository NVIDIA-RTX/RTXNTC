# RTX Neural Texture Compression (NTC) SDK v0.7.0 BETA

[Quick Start Guide](#quick-start-guide)

## Introduction

Neural Texture Compression (NTC) is an algorithm designed to compress all PBR textures used for a single material together. It works best when the texture channels are correlated with each other, for example, detail in the albedo texture corresponds to detail in the normal texture. Up to 16 texture channels can be compressed into one NTC texture set. Typical PBR materials have 9-10 channels: 3x albedo, 3x normal, metalness, roughness, ambient occlusion, opacity.

During compression, the original texture data is transformed into a combination of weights for a small neural network (decoder) and a tensor of latents or features that are sampled and passed through the decoder to reconstruct the texture colors, as is illustrated below. The sampling and decoding processes are fast enough to use them directly in the shaders that normally sample the material textures, such as base pass pixel shaders or ray tracing hit shaders. However, the decoder produces unfiltered data for only one texel, and in order to get filtered textures, we suggest using NTC in combination with [Stochastic Texture Filtering (STF)](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTXTF). For renderers targeting lower-end hardware, we suggest implementing the "Inference on Load" mode where NTC textures are decompressed when the game or map is loaded, and transcoded to one of the block-compressed formats (BCn) at the same time. There is also an advanced "Inference on Feedback" mode that uses Sampler Feedback to find the set of texture tiles needed to render the current view and then decompresses only those tiles, storing them in a sparse tiled texture as BCn.

### Example Compression Rates

NTC can be thought of as an *adjustable quality/constant bitrate lossy compression scheme*. This means that it will attempt to reconstruct the input images with minimal error while using a fixed amount of data specified as a compression time target. However, unlike block compression schemes (which have a fixed data rate for a given format) the per-texel memory footprint of a NTC-compressed texture bundle will vary based in the specified *Latent Shape* (which is the composite of the number of high- and low-resolution latent channels, the bit-depth of those high- and low-resolution channels, and the scale factor between them). Each latent shape corresponds to a given per-texel bitrate, and thus for a desired compression level a compatible latent shape can be selected which corresponds to desired bitrate as closely as possible. Furthermore, although NTC compression requires specifying a latent shape (and thus bitrate) it is possible to approximate a *constant quality/variable bitrate* approach by performing pre-analysis of the bundle to determine what formats are required to achieve a target quality level. See [Adaptive Compression](docs/SettingsAndQuality.md#adaptive-compression) for more.

To demonstrate how NTC compares to other methods, consider a material defined by the following bundle of material textures:

* Albedo Color (RGB)
* Normal (XY)
* Roughness
* Metalness
* Ambient Occlusion Factor

![Albedo, normal, roughness, metalness, ambient occlusion](docs/images/metal-plates.png)

*Example material from [MetalPlates013 from AmbientCG](https://ambientcg.com/view?id=MetalPlates013)*

Assuming 8 bits per channel and optimal channel packing, this corresponds to a bitrate of 64 bits/texel. In a contemporary pipeline this might be block-compressed into one BC7 texture for Albedo (8 bits/texel), one BC5 texture for normals (4 bits/texel), and a third BC7 texture for Roughness, Metalness, and Ambient Occlusion packed as separate channels (for another 8 bits/texel). For NTC we have found that many real-world texture bundles of this format can be compressed with results comparable to BCn (a PSNR of 40 to 50 dB) with a latent shape requiring about 3 bits/texel.

If we assume a 2k-by-2k texture resolution (and ignore the mip chains) we can compute the texture footprint of the bundle at various points in the data pipeline:

| Bundle Compression | Disk Size | PCI-E Traffic | VRAM Size |
|:-------------------|----------:|--------------:|----------:|
| Raw Image          | 32.00 MB  | 32.00 MB      | 32.00 MB  |
| BCn Compressed     | 10.00 MB  | 10.00 MB      | 10.00 MB  |
| NTC-on-Load*       |  1.52 MB  |  1.52 MB      | 10.00 MB  |
| NTC-on-Sample      |  1.52 MB  |  1.52 MB      | 1.52 MB   |

*: Assumes transcoding to equivalent BCn formats at decompression time.

See the [Settings and Quality Guide](docs/SettingsAndQuality.md) to learn more about various NTC settings and how they affect compression ratios and image quality.


### Cooperative Vector and Inference

Decompressing texels with NTC requires reading the latent data corresponding to a given texture coordinate and then performing an *inference* operation by running it through a small Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network whose weights are determined during compression and stored as part of the compressed bundle. While this operation is modest relative to the massive networks employed by many other deep learning applications it still carries a significant computational cost relative to the average pixel shader commonly seen in 3D rendering applications. Fortunately, NTC is able to benefit from new [Cooporative Vector](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_NV_cooperative_vector.html) extensions for Vulkan and Direct3D 12 which allow pixel shaders to leverage the same hardware acceleration used in large network inference. On Ada- and Blackwell-class GPUs this provides a 2-4x improvement in inference throughput over competing optimal implementations that do not utilize these new extensions.

In order to provide robust backwards compatibility, fallback implementations of the inference code using the `DP4a` instructions or regular integer math have also been provided. This will allow for the decompression code to be executed reliably on any platform that supports at least Direct3D 12 Shader Model 6; however, there will be substantial performance improvements on newer GPUs. See [System Requirements](#system-requirements) for more details.

> ### WARNING: Pre-Release Feature Dependency for Direct3D 12
> NTC texture decompression for DX12 applications, both on-load and on-sample, relies on a preview version of the [Microsoft DirectX 12 Agility SDK](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directx12agility/), specifically, `1.717.x-preview`. In order for the [Cooperative Vector](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/cooperative-vector/) extensions to work, the application must enable the `D3D12ExperimentalShaderModels` and `D3D12CooperativeVectorExperiment` features, which require that Windows is configured to  be in the Developer Mode. 
>
> A pre-release NVIDIA GPU driver version 590.26 or later is required for Shader Model 6.9 functionality.
> 
> All non-CoopVec versions of DX12 decompression, as well as all Vulkan versions including CoopVec, are OK to use for shipping.
>
> **The DX12 Cooperative Vector support is for testing purposes only. DO NOT SHIP ANY PRODUCTS USING IT.**

## Integration Guide

The SDK provides several tools for incorporating NTC into a content pipeline and engine runtime.

The `LibNTC` library provides all functionality necessary to compress, serialize/deserialize, and decompress texture sets using whatever hardware acceleration is available. It also provides implementation of a GPU-based BCn encoder to allow for transcoding decompressed textures into block-compressed format at load time, as well as a shader library demonstrating how to decompress bundle texels directly in pixel shaders at sample time.

Additionally, the `ntc-cli` tool can be included as part of any script-based pipelines if that is preferable. This tool is based on `LibNTC` as well and can perform compression and decompression tasks as desired. For more information on syntax please consult the [NTC Command-Line Tool Documentation](docs/CommandLineTool.md). Texture bundle information can be specified directly from the command line; however, the `ntc-cli` tool can also be given a [Bundle Manifest File](docs/Manifest.md) which encodes image file path, semantic and formatting information, and desired transcoding formats into one conveient serialized object. Your content pipeline can either track this information using its own database or used the provided manifest format as desired.

Further details about specific usages of `LibNTC` can be found divided by topic in the following guides, which walk through a proposed pipeline for a typical NTC application:

1. Library Initialization
    * [Installing LibNTC into your project](docs/integration/Installation.md)
    * [Initializing the context](docs/integration/Context.md)
2. Compression
    * [Compressing using LibNTC](docs/integration/Compression.md)
    * [Compression using the `ntc-cli` tool](docs/CommandLineTool.md)
    * [Texture Bundle Manifest Specification](docs/Manifest.md)
3. Decompression
    * On Load
        * [Decompressing texture sets with graphics APIs](docs/integration/InferenceOnLoad.md)
        * [Transcoding to BCn and image comparison](docs/integration/BlockCompression.md)
    * On Sample
        * [Inference on Sample using Cooporative Vector](docs/integration/InferenceOnSample.md)
    * On Feedback
        * See the [Inference on Feedback section](docs/Renderer.md#inference-on-feedback-mode) in the Renderer's Readme file.

The [NTC Explorer](docs/Explorer.md) and [NTC Renderer](docs/Renderer.md) samples demonstrate using `LibNTC` for compression and decompression and can be used as a further reference for what an integrated content workflow might look like.
